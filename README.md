# About The Project

Ontario COVID Heatmap is a React webapp that displays COVID cases by public health units, schools and long term
residences. The app also has the ability to filter by gender, outcome, age and cause. This was built over
a weekend at the [Queen's HackHer hackathon](https://qwic.org/hackHer).
